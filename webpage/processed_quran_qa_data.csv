"God has prohibited for you: the dead animal, which has left life without being slaughtered; blood; pork; meat slaughtered in the name of someone other than God; an animal strangled to death; an animal beaten to death; an animal that has fallen from a high place and died; an animal killed by another animal; and an animal that has been slaughtered for idols.

"O you who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and have established the religion, if death approaches one of you, then he should make a will, witnessed by two just men from among the Muslims, or others from non-Muslims if necessary. If you are traveling in the land and death overtakes you, then the two who are present should be called upon to witness. If there is doubt about their testimony, then they should be made to swear by Allah after the prayer, especially the 'Asr prayer, that they are speaking the truth without favor, without seeking worldly gain, and without fear or favor of the deceased's relatives. They should swear that they are not concealing the truth about Allah. If the heirs of the deceased find out that the witnesses have committed perjury, then two of the deceased's heirs should take their place and swear by Allah that their testimony is true and more acceptable than that of the perjurers. They should swear that they have not exceeded the truth in their testimony, for if they do, they will be among the wrongdoers. This is the ruling when there is doubt about the witnesses, and their testimony is not accepted. It is closer to the truth that they will bring the true testimony out of fear of the Hereafter or out of fear that their false oath will be exposed by the rightful heirs. Fear Allah, O you people, and be conscious of Him, and do not swear falsely to gain unlawful wealth. Listen to the advice you are given. Allah will not guide the rebellious who go against His command.","O you who believe, when death approaches one of you and he is making a will, two just men from among you should be witnesses, or two others from outside, if you are traveling through the land and the disaster of death overtakes you. You should detain them both after the prayer, and they shall swear by Allah, 'We will not take any reward for this testimony, even if he is a close relative, and we will not hide the testimony of Allah. For then we would indeed be of the sinful.' But if it becomes known that these two have committed a sin, then let two others stand in their place, who are more likely to be truthful. They shall swear by Allah, 'Our testimony is truer than their testimony, and we have not acted out of enmity. For then we would indeed be of the wrongdoers.' This is more likely to lead to their giving the most accurate testimony or to their fearing that other oaths will be taken after theirs. So fear Allah and listen. And Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient.","Quran Surah 5 Ayah 106:

"O Prophet, say to the hypocrites: 'Spend your wealth as you wish, whether willingly or unwillingly, for Allah will not accept your expenditures. You are a people who have turned away from the religion of Allah and His obedience.' The reason why your expenditures are not accepted is that you harbor disbelief in Allah, the Exalted, and disbelief in His Messenger, Muhammad, peace be upon him. You only come to prayer reluctantly, and you only spend your wealth unwillingly. You do not hope for any reward for these acts of charity, nor do you fear any punishment for leaving them due to your disbelief.","Explain the verses of repentance (Tawba 53-54): 'Say, 'Spend [in the way of Allah] willingly or unwillingly; it will not be accepted from you. For you were a rebellious people.' And whatever you spend [in charity], it is not accepted from you until you believe in Allah and His Messenger. And when you perform the prayer, do not be like those who are heedless, [performing] while they are eager to be done.

"God is all-knowing of the unseen and the seen, the Great in His essence and His names and attributes, transcendent over all His creation by His essence, power, and might. In His exalted knowledge, He equates those who conceal their words with those who speak them openly, and those who hide their deeds in the darkness of night with those who display them in broad daylight. God has angels who succeed one another in guarding man, both in front of him and behind him, by His command, recording all that he does, whether good or evil. God does not change the blessings He has bestowed upon a people until they change what He has commanded them, and when He wills a trial for a group, there is no averting it, and they have no protector besides Him to take charge of their affairs. He brings them the beloved and repels the hated. He shows you His signs, the lightning, which is a flash of light from the clouds, so you fear that it will bring you a bolt of burning lightning, and you hope that it will bring you rain, by His power He brings the laden clouds to you for your benefit. The thunder praises God with a praise that indicates its submission to its Lord, and the angels glorify their Lord in fear of Him, and God sends the destructive lightning that strikes whomever He wills of His creation. The disbelievers argue about God's oneness and His power over resurrection, but He is severe in punishment and powerful against the disobedient. To God alone belongs the call to unity (there is no god but God), so He is not worshipped nor invoked except Him. The deities they worship besides God do not answer the caller's invocation, and their situation is like that of a thirsty person who stretches out his hand to the water, but cannot reach it. The question of the disbelievers to them is far from the truth due to their associating others with God.",nan,"Quran Surah 13 Ayah 9:

"Solomon checked on the birds that were trained for him and the ones that were absent, and he had a special and well-known hoopoe bird, but he could not find it. He said, 'Why don't I see the hoopoe that I usually see? Has it been hidden from me, or is it among the absent ones, and I didn't see it because of its absence?' When it became clear that it was absent, he said, 'I will surely punish this hoopoe with a severe punishment for its absence, either as a deterrent or as a sacrifice for what it has done, for neglecting what it was trained for, or it may bring a clear excuse for its absence.' The hoopoe stayed away for a short time, then it came back, and Solomon rebuked it for its absence and delay. The hoopoe said, 'I have learned something that you did not know, and I have come to you from the city of Sheba in Yemen with important news, and I am certain of it. I found a woman ruling the people of Sheba, and she has everything that this world has to offer, and she has a great throne on which she sits to manage her kingdom. I found her and her people worshipping the sun, turning away from worshipping Allah, and the devil has made their evil deeds seem good to them, and has turned them away from believing in Allah and worshipping Him alone. The devil has made that seem good to them, so that they do not worship Allah, who brings out the hidden and the unseen in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you whisper and what you say openly. Allah, there is no deity worthy of worship except Him, the Lord of the great throne.' Solomon said, 'We will consider the news you have brought us, whether you are truthful or one of the liars. Take this letter of mine to the people of Sheba, give it to them, then move away from them, but stay close enough to hear their conversation, and see what they say among themselves.'",nan,"Quran Surah 27 Ayah 20:
And Sulayman (Solomon) Inspected The Birds And Said: ‘How Is It That I Do Not See The Hoopoe? Or Has He (Really) Vanished?

I Will Certainly Award Him Severe Punishment (For Being Absent Without Leave), Or Will Certainly Slaughter Him, Or He Will Bring Me A Sound Plea (Of Being Not Guilty).’

"The hoopoe went and threw the book at the queen, who read it and gathered her nobles. She said to them, 'A great book has reached me from a person of high standing.' She then explained its contents, saying, 'It is from Solomon, and it begins with 'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Do not be arrogant, nor be proud of what I have called you to, and come to me in submission to Allah, as Muslims.' She said to her nobles, 'Adviseme in this matter, for I do not decide on any matter without your consultation.' They replied, 'We are strong in numbers and equipment, and brave in war. The matter is yours, and you are the one with the wisdom. So, tell us what you command, and we will obey you.' She warned them against facing Solomon with hostility and explained the futility of war, saying, 'Kings, when they enter a town, ravage it and make its nobles humble. This is their consistent way of instilling fear in people.' She sent a gift to Solomon and his people, and awaited the return of the messengers. When the queen's messenger arrived with the gift, Solomon said, 'Do you try to bribe me with money to please me? What Allah has given me in prophecy, kingship, and abundant wealth is better than what He has given you. Rather, it is you who rejoice in the gift that is given to you, for you are proud of this world and boast about it.' Solomon said to the messenger of the people of Sheba, 'Go back to them, for by Allah, we will send them armies against which they will have no power to resist or confront. We will drive them out of their land in humiliation and disgrace, unless they submit to Allah's religion alone and abandon the worship of anything else.' Solomon asked, 'Which of you will bring me the throne of the queen before they come to me in submission?' A powerful and strong jinn said, 'I will bring it to you before you rise from your seat. I am strong enough to carry it, and I am trustworthy; I will bring it to you as it is, without diminishing or changing anything.' The one who had knowledge of the Book said, 'I will bring it to you before your eyelid drops.' Solomon gave him permission, and he invoked Allah and brought the throne. When Solomon saw it present before him, he said, 'This is from the favor of my Lord to test me: whether I will be grateful for this blessing or ungrateful. Whoever is grateful does so for his own benefit, and whoever is ungrateful, my Lord is Independent, Most Generous. He bestows His bounty on whomever He wills, both in this world and the Hereafter.' Solomon said to those around him, 'Change the queen's throne into a different form when she sees it; let us see if she will recognize it or be one of those who do not recognize it.' When the queen of Sheba came to Solomon in his assembly, she was asked, 'Is this your throne?' She said, 'It is like it.' Solomon knew that she had recognized it and believed in Allah's power and Solomon's prophecy. He said, 'We have been given knowledge before it, and we were Muslims.' What prevented her from worshipping Allah alone was what she used to worship besides Him. She was from a people who were disbelievers. Although she had intelligence and understanding, false beliefs can mislead one's judgment. She was told, 'Enter the glass palace,' and when she saw it, she thought it was water, and she uncovered her legs to wade in it. Solomon said, 'It is a glass floor with water underneath.' She realized the greatness of Solomon's kingdom and said, 'Lord, I have wronged myself, and I submit with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.'",What is the story of Solomon (peace be upon him) with the Queen of Sheba?,"Quran Surah 27 Ayah 29:

"Moses entered the city secretly during the people's carelessness. He found two men fighting: one from his own people, the Israelites, and the other from Pharaoh's people. The Israelite asked Moses for help against his enemy, so Moses struck the other man with his fist and killed him. Moses said, 'This is from the work of Satan. He incited my anger, and I struck this man, causing his death. Satan is indeed an enemy to man, leading him astray from the right path, and openly hostile.' This event happened before Moses' prophethood. Moses said, 'Lord, I have wronged my soul by killing a person without being commanded to do so. Please forgive me for this sin.' God forgave him. God is indeed forgiving to the sins of His servants, merciful to them. Moses said, 'Lord, because of Your grace in granting me repentance, forgiveness, and many blessings, I will not be a helper to anyone who disobeys You or commits crimes.' The next morning, Moses was in Pharaoh's city, afraid and waiting for news about himself and the man he had killed. He saw the man he had helped the day before fighting another Egyptian, asking for his help. Moses said, 'You are indeed a great sinner, openly misguided.' When Moses tried to attack the Egyptian, he said, 'Do you want to kill me as you killed the man yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant on earth, not one who brings people together.' A man from the other end of the city came running, saying, 'Moses, the leaders of Pharaoh's people are plotting to kill you. They are consulting each other, so leave this city. I am one of those who advise and care for you.' Moses left Pharaoh's city in fear, waiting for them to pursue and capture him.

"When Moses intended to travel to the land of Midian and left the dominion of Pharaoh, he said, 'Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the right path.' When he arrived at the water of Midian, he found there a group of people watering their livestock, and he found two women holding back their flock from the water. They were unable to push their way forward with the men, and they waited until the men had watered their livestock before watering their own. When Moses saw this, he was moved with compassion for them and said, 'What is the matter with you?' They said, 'We cannot push our way forward with the men, and our father is an old man who cannot do this himself.' So Moses watered their livestock for them, then sat down in the shade of a tree and said, 'Lord, I am in need of whatever good You may send me.' He was very hungry. Then one of the women came to him, walking modestly, and said, 'My father invites you to accept payment for watering our livestock.' So Moses went with her to her father. When he arrived and told him the story of Pharaoh and his people, the old man said, 'Do not be afraid, you have escaped from the unjust people, and they are Pharaoh and his people. They have no power here.' One of the women said to her father, 'Father, hire him to tend your livestock; the best person to hire is the strong and trustworthy one who will not betray your trust.' The old man said to Moses, 'I want to marry you to one of my daughters, on the condition that you work for me for eight years tending my livestock. If you complete ten years, it will be a kindness from you, and I do not want to make it difficult for you by making it ten. You will find me, if God wills, among the righteous in good companionship and fulfilling my promises.' Moses said, 'That is agreed between you and me. I will work for you for the time you have specified, and I will not be cheated.

"Qarun was from the people of Moses (peace be upon him). He transgressed against them with pride and arrogance, and we gave him from our treasures a great amount of wealth, to the extent that the keys to it were heavy for many strong men to carry. His people said to him, 'Do not be arrogant because of what you have been given. Indeed, Allah does not love the arrogant who are ungrateful.' Seek in what Allah has given you of wealth the reward of the Hereafter by doing righteous deeds in this world, and do not neglect your share of this world by indulging in it excessively, and do good to people with it, as Allah has done good to you with this abundant wealth. And do not seek what Allah has made forbidden for you by oppressing your people. Indeed, Allah does not love the corrupt.' Qarun said to his people who advised him, 'I was given this wealth because of my knowledge and power. Did Qarun not know that Allah had destroyed before him from the nations those who were stronger than him and had more wealth?' He went out to his people in his finery, wanting to show off his greatness and wealth. Those who desired the life of this world said, 'Would that we had what Qarun has been given of wealth, finery, and status! Indeed, Qarun has a great share of this world.' But those who had knowledge of Allah and His religion and understood the truth of the matter said to those who said that, 'Woe to you! Fear Allah and obey Him. The reward of Allah is better for one who believes and does righteous deeds than what Qarun has been given. And no one accepts this advice and is guided by it and acts upon it except one who struggles against his own self, endures in the obedience of his Lord, and avoids His disobedience.' So we caused the earth to swallow Qarun and his household. He had no army to help him besides Allah, and he was not of those who could save themselves. Those who desired his state the day before said the next day, 'Would that Allah would increase the provision for us as He has increased it for some of His servants. Would that we had not been of those who were reminded.' Indeed, you cannot will unless Allah wills. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.",Recite the story of Qarun?,"Quran Surah 28 Ayah 76:

"The disbelievers of Quraysh are those who denied the oneness of God, hindered you from entering the Sacred Mosque on the day of Hudaybiyyah, prevented the sacrifice, and detained it from reaching its destination, which is the sacred place. If it were not for some oppressed believers, men and women, living among these disbelievers in Mecca, concealing their faith out of fear for themselves, you would not have known them, lest you attack them with your army and kill them, and thus incur bloodshed, sin, and blame without knowledge. But We have given you power over them. God will show mercy to whomever He wills and guide them to faith after disbelief. If these believers and believing women had distinguished themselves from the polytheists of Mecca and left them, We would have punished those who disbelieved and rejected them with a painful, severe punishment.

Among these things is their refusal to write in the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah 'In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate,' and their refusal to write what Muhammad, the Messenger of God, had judged. God sent down tranquility upon His messenger and the believers with him and made it obligatory for them to say, 'There is no god but God,' which is the foundation of all piety. The Messenger, peace be upon him, and the believers with him were more deserving of this word of piety than the polytheists, and they were more entitled to it. God is all-knowing; nothing is hidden from Him.

When the angels, recording, sit on his right and his left, recording his deeds. That on his right records his good deeds, and that on his left records his sins. Whatever he speaks, an angel is present, recording it, an angel appointed for that purpose. And the intense horror of the Day of Judgment has come, the truth that cannot be turned away or escaped. That which you, O man, have been fleeing from. The trumpet will be blown for the second blast, that blast on the Day of Promise, which Allah promised the disbelievers. And every soul will come with it two angels, one driving it to the gathering, and the other testifying against it for what it did in the world, good or evil. Indeed, you were heedless of this, O man, but We have removed your cover from you, so today your sight is strong. And the recording angel will say, 'This is what I have of his record, and it is with me, preserved, present.' Allah will say to the driving and recording angels, after they have separated the people, 'Throw every stubborn disbeliever into the Hellfire, the one who disbelieved and turned away from the truth, who withheld what was due to others, transgressed against Allah's servants and His limits, doubted His promise and threat, who associated others with Allah, so worshipped with Him another besides Him, created from His creation, so throw him into the severe punishment of the Hellfire.' His companion, who was with him in the world, will say, 'Our Lord, we did not guide him, but he was in a far astray.' Allah will say, 'Do not dispute with me today, the Day of Reckoning and Account, for there is no benefit in that. I have already warned you in the world with the threat for those who disbelieved in me and defied me. My decision will not be changed, and I do not punish anyone for the sin of another. No, I punish only when the proof against him is established.' Remember, O Messenger, to remind your people on the Day when We will say to the Hellfire, 'Have you been filled?'

"I swear by Allah, the Most High, by the stars when they set, that Muhammad (peace be upon him) did not deviate from the path of guidance and truth, nor did he go astray, but rather he was in the utmost state of uprightness, balance, and righteousness, and his speech was not based on his own desire. The Quran and the Sunnah are nothing but a revelation from Allah to His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Allah taught Muhammad (peace be upon him) an angel of great strength and beautiful appearance, who is Gabriel (peace be upon him). Gabriel appeared to the Prophet (peace be upon him) in his true form at the highest horizon, which is the horizon of the sun at its rising. Then Gabriel approached the Prophet (peace be upon him), coming closer and closer, until he was as close as two bow-lengths or even closer. Then Allah, the Most High, revealed to His servant Muhammad (peace be upon him) through Gabriel (peace be upon him). Muhammad's heart did not belie what his eyes saw. Do you deny Muhammad (peace be upon him) and argue with him about what he sees and observes from the signs of his Lord? Muhammad (peace be upon him) saw Gabriel in his true form again, at the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary, which is a tree in the seventh heaven, where all that is raised from the earth ends, and where all that is cast down from above ends. There is a great matter at the Lote Tree from Allah, the description of which is known only to Allah, the Mighty and Majestic. The Prophet (peace be upon him) was in a state of great steadfastness and obedience, so he did not move his gaze to the right or left, nor did he exceed what he was commanded to see. Muhammad (peace be upon him) saw the Night of Ascension from the great signs of his Lord, indicating Allah's power and greatness, including Paradise, Hellfire, and other things.","And the star when it falls, Your companion has not strayed, nor has he erred, Nor does he speak of his own desire. It is only a revelation that is revealed. He was taught by one mighty in power. One standing, while he was on the highest horizon. Then he approached and descended, until he was two bow lengths or closer, or even nearer. He revealed to His servant what he revealed. His heart did not lie about what he saw. Will you dispute with him about what he sees? And indeed, he saw him in another descent, At the lotus tree of the boundary, Near it is the garden of the abode, When there covered the lotus tree what covered it.

"When Joseph had prepared his brothers for their journey, he ordered his servants to place the royal measuring cup in Benjamin's sack without anyone knowing. When they had set out, a crier called out, 'O caravan, you are surely thieves!' The brothers turned to the crier and asked, 'What have you lost?' The crier replied, 'We have lost the king's measuring cup, and the reward for its return is a camel load of grain. I myself will guarantee the camel load.' The brothers said, 'Indeed, we have come to this land not to cause corruption, and it is not in our nature to be thieves.' The searchers asked the brothers, 'What is the punishment for theft in your land, if you are lying about not being thieves?' The brothers replied, 'The punishment for the thief whose stolen goods are found with him is that he must return them and become a slave to the one he stole from. This is how we punish those who commit theft, and this is our law and custom in such cases.' They returned to Joseph, and he himself searched their belongings, starting with their own and then with Benjamin's, to ensure that his plan to keep Benjamin with him would succeed. He finally reached Benjamin's sack, from which he took out the measuring cup. Thus, we made Joseph's plan successful in keeping his brother with him, and he would not have been able to take his brother as a slave according to the law of the Egyptian king. But God willed it this way and judged the matter according to the law of the brothers, which decreed that the thief should be enslaved.

"We tested the people of Mecca with hunger and drought, as we tested the owners of the garden when they swore to pluck its fruits early in the morning, without allowing anyone but the poor and the needy to eat from it, and they did not say: 'Insha'Allah'. So, Allah sent fire upon it at night while they were asleep, and it was burned and became black like the dark night. In the morning, they called out to each other: 'Go early to your garden, if you are determined to pluck its fruits.' They hurried, whispering to each other: 'Do not let any of the poor enter your garden today.' They went to their garden early in the morning, determined to prevent the poor from its fruits, thinking they had the power to do so. When they saw their garden burned, they denied it, saying: 'We have lost our way to it.' When they realized it was their garden, they said: 'Rather, we are deprived of its goodness because of our determination to be stingy and prevent the poor.' He said to them: 'Did I not tell you to say: 'Insha'Allah'? They said after they came to their senses: 'May Allah, our Lord, be free from injustice in what has befallen us, but we were unjust to ourselves by not saying 'Insha'Allah' and by our evil intention.' They turned to each other, blaming one another for not saying 'Insha'Allah' and for their evil intention. They said: 'Woe to us! We have been excessive in preventing the poor and disobeying Allah's command. We hope that our Lord will give us something better than our garden because of our repentance and admission of our sin. We are eager for our Lord alone, seeking forgiveness, asking for good.' Such is the punishment that befell the owners of the garden.

Then he was cursed again, and he pondered what he had planned to slander in the Quran. He tightened his face and neck in what he said and increased in tightening and constriction, then turned away from faith and became arrogant towards following the Prophet (peace be upon him), saying about the Quran, 'What Muhammad says is nothing but sorcery that is passed down from the ancients. This is nothing but the words of created beings that Muhammad has learned from them, and then he claims that it is from God.'

But Allah knows its value, and it is not something that increases in value or makes up for his evil deeds. Have we not made for him eyes, a tongue, and lips that he may speak, and shown him the paths of good and evil? Then why does he not strive to avoid the hardship of the Hereafter by spending his wealth, so that he may be safe? And what is better for you to know: what is the hardship of the Hereafter, and what relieves it? It is the freeing of a believing slave from the fetters of slavery, or feeding a relative in need on a day of severe famine, or giving to a poor person who has nothing. Then, along with these acts of kindness, they also performed other good deeds, and advised each other to be patient in obeying Allah and avoiding His disobedience, and showed mercy to the creation. Those who did these deeds are the companions of the right hand, who will be taken on the Day of Resurrection to Paradise on the right. But those who rejected the Quran will be taken on the Day of Resurrection to Hell on the left. Their reward is Hell, which is prepared for them, closed upon them.","Do you think that no one has power over him? He says, 'I have destroyed wealth lavishly. Do you think that no one saw him? Have We not given him two eyes, a tongue, and two lips? And guided him to the two clear paths? Then he did not attempt the steep path. And what do you know about the steep path? It is the freeing of a neck or feeding on a day of severe hunger to an orphan related to you or a poor person in misery. Then he was of those who believed and advised each other to patience and advised each other to mercy. Those are the companions of the right hand. And those who disbelieved in Our verses, they are the companions of the left hand. Upon them is a fire closed in.","Quran Surah 90 Ayah 5:

Read, O Prophet, what has been revealed to you, for your Lord is indeed Most Generous, Most Bountiful, who taught humanity writing with the pen, taught them what they did not know, and brought them out of darkness into light. Indeed, man transgresses the limits of Allah when wealth corrupts him. Let every tyrant know that the ultimate destination is to Allah, and He will reward each person according to their deeds. Have you seen the audacity of that man (he is Abu Jahl) who forbids one of our slaves (he is Muhammad, may Allah bless him) from praying to his Lord? Have you seen if he forbids from guidance, how can he forbid? Or if he commands others to piety, where is his guidance? Have you seen if he denies this forbidding and turns away, did he not know that Allah sees all that he does? The matter is not as Abu Jahl claims. If he does not turn from his obstinacy and arrogance, we will certainly seize him by the forelock and throw him into the fire. His forehead is a lying forehead in its speech and wrong in its actions. Let this tyrant bring his companions from his tribe, for we will call upon the angels of punishment. The matter is not as Abu Jahl thinks. You, O Prophet, will not be harmed by him, so do not obey him in what he has invited you to leave the prayer, and prostrate to your Lord and draw near to Him through obedience.","Explain the meaning of the following verses: 'Read in the name of your Lord who created (1), who created man from a clinging substance (2).

Indeed, to your Lord is the return (8). Have you seen the one who prevents (9) a servant when he prays (10)? Have you seen if he was on the right guidance (11) or commanded righteousness (12)?

"Those who disbelieved among the Jews, Christians, and pagans did not leave their disbelief until the sign they were promised in the previous books came to them. That sign is the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad (peace be upon him), reciting the Quran on pure pages. On those pages are true news and fair decrees, guiding to the truth and the straight path. Those who received the scriptures from the Jews and Christians did not differ in considering Muhammad (peace be upon him) as a true messenger due to his description in their books, except after it became clear to them that he was the prophet promised in the Torah and the Gospel. Then they agreed on the truth of his prophethood, but when he was sent, they denied him and became divided. They were commanded in all previous religions to worship Allah alone, seeking His face in their worship, turning away from associating partners with Him, establishing prayer, and giving zakat.
